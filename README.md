# Obsidian PARA Vault Boilerplate

**Available languages:** English | [Ελληνικά](README.el.md) | [Deutsch](README.de.md)

This is a ready-to-use folder structure for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), based on the PARA method by Tiago Forte. It’s designed to help ordinary people bring order to their digital lives, manage personal projects, and keep track of what matters. It’s practical, simple, and built to grow with you.

## What is Obsidian?

Obsidian is a free note-taking application that turns your plain text Markdown files into a network of linked notes. It stores everything locally on your computer, so your notes are private, portable, and yours to organize however you like.

Obsidian supports folders, tags, backlinks, and plugins. It works well whether you want to journal, manage tasks, write long-form content, or build a second brain.

## What is PARA?

PARA is a method for organizing information. It divides your notes and files into four main categories:

- **Projects** – short-term efforts with a clear goal or outcome (e.g. "Renovate the kitchen", "30-Day Fitness Challenge")
- **Areas** – long-term responsibilities you want to maintain (e.g. "Health", "Finances", "Family")
- **Resources** – reference materials and topics you’re interested in (e.g. "Photography", "Nutrition", "Job Search Tips")
- **Archives** – things that are no longer active but still worth keeping (e.g. finished projects, old documents)

By separating short-term work from long-term commitments and separating both from general reference material, PARA helps reduce clutter and make decisions easier.

## Why use this?

Many people struggle with scattered thoughts, messy files, and too many tools. This vault gives you one place to put everything. It’s organized but flexible. You can start small and let it grow as you go.

This structure is meant for real life: for people with families, jobs, hobbies, and responsibilities. It's not about productivity for the sake of it. It's about keeping track of what matters and making space for what helps.

## What’s in this vault

The folder structure is already set up. Every major folder contains a short explanation in English, Greek, and German, so it’s clear what it’s for.

### Projects

This folder includes sample projects to help you get started. These are simple, real-life projects like:

- 30-Day Fitness Challenge
- Digital Declutter Week
- Start a Book Club
- Volunteer Coding Workshop

Each project has subfolders like “Planning”, “Notes”, “Reference”, and “Archive” so you can keep everything in one place.

### Areas

This folder is where your long-term responsibilities live. It includes categories like:

- Family
- Work
- Health & Wellness
- Finances
- Home
- Legal & Documents
- Personal Development
- Social & Community

Each one is divided into useful subfolders (for example, Health includes Appointments, Nutrition, Mental Health, etc.).

### Resources

A well-organized digital library for your interests and reference material. Topics include:

- Tech and Coding
- Creativity and Design
- Knowledge Library
- Finance and Legal
- Tools and Systems
- Personal Life
- Productivity and Workflow

Inside each category, you’ll find subfolders for things like articles, guides, templates, and more.

### Archives

This is where you move things that are no longer active but you don’t want to delete. There are folders for archived Projects, Areas, and Resources.

### _system

This folder is used by Obsidian to store templates and attachments. You can set the `templates` and `files` folders in Obsidian’s settings under:

- Settings > Files & Links
- Settings > Templates

## Who is this for

This is for anyone who wants to get organized, make space in their mind, and take better care of their ideas. It’s especially helpful if you:

- Feel overwhelmed by scattered notes and files
- Want to manage personal projects in a simple way
- Are trying to stay focused and balanced in your daily life
- Just want a fresh start with a clear structure

You don’t need to be a productivity expert. You just need a place to start.

## Final note

This vault isn’t a system you have to follow perfectly. It’s a foundation you can build on. Change it, grow with it, and make it your own.

If it helps even one person feel more in control, more creative, or more at peace, it has done its job.
